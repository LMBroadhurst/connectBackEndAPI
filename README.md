# CONNECT
An Informal Social Media App for networking and connecting professionals by their interests and aspirations.

## PROJECT VISION

Formal networks within organisations offer little room for emotions, feelings or sharing of personal thoughts. By relying on Connect, professionals can enjoy easy conversations and bond, without the pressures of conforming strictly to generic corporate culture. 

Connect aims to do this by creating a network of professionals, ready to support and bond with each other over common career interests. Connect will encourage users to attend networking events and socials with others on the site, allowing for relationships to strengthen and develop further.
